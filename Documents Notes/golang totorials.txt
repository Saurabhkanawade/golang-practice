 Q : Go Compilation ?

 

*  keyword : 20 

* it does not allow unused imports 


*** features :
		type : compiled 
		Structure: Procedural
		Errors Handling : Errors 
		Typing : Static ( you can not change the type of datatype once you declare ) type casting is not possible in go
		concurrent programming is used in go
		it supports channels and goroutines : channel :channels are a means through which different goroutines communicate
		goroutines : goroutines means a function that execute simultaneously 
		it supports the interface   
		go is more verbose ( code is more )
		good for system programming
		inheritance is not supported 
		gc
